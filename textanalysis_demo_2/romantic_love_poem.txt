I found you in the quiet spaces of ordinary days,
where nothing special was supposed to happen.
You arrived like a soft certainty,
not loud, not demanding,
but steady enough to change the way I breathe.

Loving you feels like learning a familiar song
I somehow knew before I heard it.
Your laughter settles my restless thoughts,
your silence understands me
better than most words ever could.

I love the way your presence
turns simple moments into memories:
shared glances across a room,
hands brushing without intention,
the comfort of knowing someone is there,
even when the world feels too heavy.

With you, love is not a storm,
but a constant horizon.
It is choosing each other
in the small decisions,
in patience, in forgiveness,
in staying when leaving would be easier.

I love you in the mornings,
when the day is still undecided,
and in the nights,
when doubts try to speak louder than hope.
I love you in growth and in fear,
in becoming and in uncertainty.

If love is measured in promises,
then mine is quiet but endless.
I promise to listen,
to learn you again and again,
to hold space for your dreams,
and to walk beside you,
not ahead, not behind,
but with you.

And if one day words fail me,
let my actions speak.
Let them say that loving you
was never a question,
only a choice I make
every single day.
